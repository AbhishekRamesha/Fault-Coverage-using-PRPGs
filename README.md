# Fault-Coverage-using-PRPGs

The main aim of this project is to create Pseudo-Random Test Patterns [PRPGs] to perform Fault coverage analysis for a given circuit. The PRPGs are generated using a counter and Linear Feedback Shift Registers [LFSRs]. The LFSRs are further assigned with taps at different nodes to create different patterns. The functionalities of this project include Fault List Generation, Complete Fault Coverage, Test Vector Generation using Counter, and LFSRs.
